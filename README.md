# Pet-Sim-COMPE-260

This is a project that was created for my COMPE 260 Course focused on Databases and Object Oriented Programing. The focus of the project is to create a pet animal the user can interact with and in turn affect their hunger and boredom levels. Additionally I allowed the user to save their pet for future uses.

A potential for future modification would be to create gui for this and expand on the game to create minigames to play with the pet to create a Tamagotchi like game.
